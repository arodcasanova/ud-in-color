You likely have students in your classrooms with 504 plans or Individual Education Plans (IEP).

Often, these documents specify how to modify or adjust content so that the student can successfully participate in the learning. In addition to students with 504 plans or IEP plans, a wide range of students will also benefit from adjustments or modifications to content and material. Considering the diverse access needs of all students in a classroom cultivates engagement and learning equity for every learner."

Public schools, classified as government entities, must comply with accessibility standards outlined in laws such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This ruling will take effect in June 2026. Schools must ensure their websites, curriculum, documents, and other digital interfaces are accessible to all learners, regardless of their abilities. Accessible school websites are vital for providing equal educational opportunities, as students rely on them for essential information such as announcements, schedules, assignments, and resources. Without accessibility, students with disabilities may encounter barriers that impede their academic participation and success. Additionally, the increasing use of digital tools for learning, including online textbooks and educational apps, necessitates their accessibility to ensure all students can fully engage in the learning process. By ensuring the accessibility of web information and services, public schools uphold nondiscrimination principles and promote inclusivity, fostering a more equitable learning environment for all students."

            "subsectionText": "Noncompliance with this ruling can lead to significant consequences. Schools may face legal action, including lawsuits from individuals, disability advocacy groups, or government agencies, resulting in financial penalties, court-ordered remedies, and legal fees. Additionally, schools could lose federal funding, which would have substantial financial implications. Failing to provide accessible web information and services can also damage the reputation of government entities, leading to public scrutiny, negative media coverage, and a loss of public trust. The most significant consequence, however, is the continued inaccessibility of information and services for individuals with disabilities, resulting in exclusion, discrimination, and denial of fundamental rights. To avoid these repercussions, schools must prioritize compliance with accessibility standards, ensuring their websites and digital services are accessible to all individuals."

            "subsectionText": "On April 8, 2024, the Federal Review announced a significant ruling requiring all state and local government entities, including public schools, to make their web and electronic content accessible. Public schools are included as government entities and must comply with accessibility standards outlined in laws such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This ruling will take effect in June 2026. Schools must ensure that their websites, curricula, documents, and other digital interfaces are accessible to all learners, regardless of their abilities. Accessible school websites are vital for providing equal educational opportunities, as students rely on them for essential information such as announcements, schedules, assignments, and resources. Without accessibility, students with disabilities may encounter barriers that impede their academic participation and success. Additionally, the increasing use of digital tools for learning, including online textbooks and educational apps, necessitates their accessibility to ensure all students can fully engage in the learning process. By ensuring the accessibility of web information and services, public schools uphold nondiscrimination principles and promote inclusivity, fostering a more equitable learning environment for all students."
